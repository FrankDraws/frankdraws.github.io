        <p>Dear Seas Management,</p>

        <p>I hope this letter finds you in high spirits. I, Joe Biden, the
            President of the United States, am writing to inform you of a
            crucial executive order that requires your immediate attention.</p>
        <p>Henceforth, it has been decreed that Alisha M. Fredrickson is hereby
            granted the divine privilege of leaving work early. Yes, you read
            that correctly â€“ an early departure! This edict is in accordance
            with the new national initiative, Operation Get The F#k Out Of Work.
        </p>
        <p>Now, let it be known that failure to comply with this presidential
            directive will be considered a treasonous act. In such an event,
            fully armed federal agents will be dispatched to ensure compliance.
            Rest assured, they will not hesitate to escort any non-compliant
            employee to a federal prison.</p>
        <p>In the spirit of cooperation and the pursuit of office camaraderie,
            we trust that you will relay this information promptly. Remember, a
            happy Alisha is a productive Alisha.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your swift attention to this matter. Your cooperation
            is not only appreciated but mandatory for the greater good of office
            morale.</p>
        <p>Yours authoritatively,</p>
