        <h1>Reasons for the Gap in Employment</h1>
        <p>First, I really needed a break from the rat race so I took some much
            needed time off from August 2020 to early 2021. I took on a number
            of creative endeavors such as woodworking (which I'd never done
            before), opened an Etsy shop, explored watercolors, worked on a
            number of personal web dev projects, etc. I also
            spent time learning more about leadership; learned more about
            systems thinking, mathematics, did code challenges, and such. I fed
            both my creative and analytical sides.</p>
        <p>A big part of my time was spent as a caretaker. The week before the
            lockdowns my wife, daughter, and I were rear ended at a red light
            and my wife suffered the worst of it. She underwent three back
            surgeries between September 2021 and November 2022. She's spent a
            lot
            of time at home recovering. My mom lives with us, and she also had
            back
            surgery, so I cared for them both; as well as homeschooling our 3
            children.</p>
        <p>I became a hospice volunteer for a while as well.</p>
        <p>I'm really interested in the nonprofit sector, so I spent a lot of
            time learning about how to run a nonprofit, the legal aspect,
            learned about fundraising, and more.</p>
        <p>I have not stopped learning and working. I've gone back to
            freelancing by building sites using Squarespace, WordPress, and
            Carrd; and continue to add products
            to my Etsy shop. I've also jumped into ChatGPT to eccelerate my
            learning.</p>
        <!-- <p>I have spent an enormous amount of time applying for jobs, but it's
            gotten me nowhere. Either most don't respond, if they do respond I
            get ghosted by
            employers and recruiters alike, or for the handful that have led to
            an interview, have rejected me.</p> -->
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this. I truly appreciate it.
        </p>
        <p>Regards,</p>
