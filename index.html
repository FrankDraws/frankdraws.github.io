                <strong>Font Mapping for Universal Parks &amp; Resorts</strong><br>
                <span>
              I was instrumental in the font change from Gotham to Avenir Next for Universal Parks &amp; Resorts digital properties including Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Hollywood. I helped solved technical font issues in order for the team to test and deploy. I audited the site, put together documentation and tests showing how
              the font change would affect pages. </span><br>
