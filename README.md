Welcome to my website. 

You can view the live site at [FrankJuval.com](https://www.frankjuval.com).

## Description
This site is to simply showcase some of the work I've done over the past several years. Currently, all the work displayed is from my time at Universal Parks & Resorts. Eventually I will add other projects.

I also like to use this site as a reason to tinker and experiment with design and code. So if you happen to see it change or look under the hood and wonder what kind of mad science is going on, you'll know why. 

## Contributing
This site is for my personal use. Although, if anyone feels like creating their own version, fork away.
