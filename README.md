Welcome to my website! This isn't just a plain ol' website. It's my sandbox. A place for me to tinker and explore.

You can view the live version at [FrankJuval.com](https://www.frankjuval.com).

## Description
This site is to simply showcase some of the work I've done over the past several years. Currently, all the work displayed is from my time at Universal Parks & Resorts. Eventually I will add other projects.

I also like to use this site as a reason to tinker and experiment with design and code. So if you happen to look under the hood and wonder what kind of mad science is going on, you'll know why. 

## Contributing
This site is for my personal use. Although, if anyone feels like creating their own version, fork away.
